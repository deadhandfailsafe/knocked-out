# Knocked Out
A narrative creating traditional game of armored fighting vehicles, and the hell their crews lived with.

The idea is to eventually allow the game to functionally handle/allow any sort of AFV from any era WW2-Modern. This base system will start with World War 2 as there is already an incredibly expansive amount of data collected on the various AFVs involved, as well as the systems on these vehicles being far less complex than they are today. Eventually a wider range of vehicle types will be allowed as well, from a platoon of soft skin TOW Humvees to a platoon of Super Heavy Maus tanks.

A key component of the game is random generation. Missions and enemies included will all be randomly generated, with the option to generate even more things such as your own platoon's force composition. A platoon of Sherman tanks most likely did not all have Easy Eights. Maybe one tank is an E8, while the rest are regular Shermans. Or in a Russian T34 platoon, you might get one T-34-85, and 2 T-34/76's. One might be the 1941 model, one might be the 1943 model.

Combat in relation to your own vehicle and crew is incredibly detailed and brutal, as is their perspective of it. Damage to enemy or other allied systems will be far more simpler as your crew surely won't so easily see the extent of the damage to others.

Low rolls are better.

The big focus is going to be on three or four nations for now. USA, RUS, and GER. There might be room for UK/COM and FRA as well. It's possible to eventually allow Czech, Italy, Japan, Poland and other nations using lended vehicles, but other than that, it's probably up to your own homebrewing.

2D6 system following same armor numbers and some rules from ASL for a prototype. Units will face hex spines and use the same type of ASL Combat Arc.


### The Game Pace:
So far the game should in general run through about 5 phases. Sometimes 6.

- A. Setting up a Game
    - Pick Theatre/Nation/Time Period
    - Pick AFVs or roll for them.
    - Generate Crews
    - Determine availability of supplies

- B. Garage Duties
    - General Management of Crew/Vehicles, Supplies, Repairs, Upgrades, Etc.
    - Crew/Vehicle Replacements
    - Check for Campaign Failure

- C. Mission
    - Generate a mission
    - Play the mission

- D. Results
    - Examine what happened and generate any final rolls or results

- E. Advance the Campaign
    - Move time forward
    - Look at the big picture aspect

A simplified damage tree. Incoming shot on a tank hits. Does it hit the hull or the turret? It hits the hull. Does it hit the armor, an armament, the suspension, or any PRCs? It hits the armor. It pens, does it hit the engine, radio, fuel, crew, optics/slits, etc.. These are most of the core components one could expect to find in almost any tank and systems one should keep aware of for full functionality in combat. Obviously certain tanks may have a few extra bits, or a few less, those will be the special cases and would note such things.

### Generating Crew
Crew will be randomly assigned in terms of quality and traits, and here is where they are all initially generated to fill out your vehicles.

| Dice Total | Crew Quality |
|:----------:|--------------|
| 2          | Excellent    |
| 3-4        | Good         |
| 5-9        | Average      |
| 10-11      | Poor         |
| 12         | Awful        |

Certain crew members will be required for certain ability rolls, based on their skills the rolls will be modified as so:

| Modifier | Crew Skill |
|:--------:|------------|
| -2       | Excellent  |
| -1       | Good       |
| 0        | Average    |
| +1       | Poor       |
| +2       | Awful      |


### Availability of Supplies
Before starting a campaign with your assembled platoon, you will need to determine the availability of supplies. This will act as a chance modifier for you to resupply or refresh various supplies, munitions, or systems. This can change as the campaign progresses based on any certain circumstance or event happening.

| Dice Total | Supply Availability |
|:----------:|---------------------|
| 2-3        | Full                |
| 4-7        | Mid                 |
| 8-11       | Low                 |
| 12         | None                |

## B. Garage Duty
This is the stage you return to after you complete a mission and generate any sort of results in terms of crew morale or events, and manage any needed details such as rearming, refreshing, replacing crew and vehicles.

### Crew Morale
At the start of a campaign and after a mission, crew morale needs to be established/restablished. Morale can also shift mid-encounter due to certain events, but in the end this is where it all really mounts up.

### Repairs and Medical
If any repairs or medical services are needed, this is where they are requisitioned. Instead of using a system of waiting a certain amount of days or etc, specific issues will have a percentage to be solved during this phase. If they fail, during the next Garage Phase, the level will be degraded by one in the direction of being easier. For EX: Let's say Level 1 medical issue has a 80% chance of being dealt with this phase, a level 2 60%, and a level 3 40%. If a level 3 failed the pass, during the next garage phase after the next mission, it would be degraded to a level 2 issue, and thus be easier. Failing a level 1 would make it an auto pass at the next garage phase.

### Resupply
If needed, you can call for resupply. This will fall into a random range and is affected by your campaign supply availability. It will follow a somewhat similar system to repairs and medical where it will be abstracted into a pass fail type of thing. There will also be varying maximum supply possibilities in combination with the ability to get supplies in the first place. For example let's say low supplies means that if you did get supplies you could only get 25% of your total back. This would also mean that in inverse, you would not be allowed to give any AFV more than a 75% total supply amount as others would need such scarce supplies more. Supplies will never be removed from you in such an event, but you won't be deemed necessary to receive more.

### Replacements
When things get destroyed or killed, they need to be replaced and things WILL be destroyed and killed. Vehicle replacements could potentially net you an upgrade in the end, or in rare cases a downgrade. Crew replacements will follow the Chapter A generation system and come in as a new green crewman. Vehicle replacements could potentially take longer. Also continuously having to replace AFVs and crew could lead to negative overall effects or even fail you a campaign.

### Campaign Failure
A combination and accumulation of certain things could lead to a campaign gave over.

- - - -


## C. Missions
After a Garage Phase, it's time to be sent out on your next mission. First a mission type will be generated, and then in relation to that type, a location and encounter will be generated. Then the mission will be played.

### The Mission Types:
Each mission is rolled with 1D6. 1 mostly being easier/safer and 6 being hardest/lethal

1. **Defense**: Generally easy. Sit there and let them come to you. Generally at an advantage, depending on a held position. Most likely to see them before they see you. If you roll this mission, roll another 1D6, and on a 6, this becomes a fighting retreat which is suddenly much more difficult.

2. **Escort**: Protect those who are less protected in moving to another location.

3. **Infantry Support**: Move with Infantry and assist them with their objectives in combined arms.

4. **Tank Hunting**: Find and eliminate enemy tanks that have been causing trouble. Pretty risky, chances are they will see you first.

5. **Assault**: You are part of a massive push to assault/siege a heavily developed/defensive position. Good luck.

6. **Ambush**: You are ambushed while moving somewhere else. Chances are a few men are going to die. If you roll this mission, roll another 1D6, and on a 1, this becomes a mission where you are conducting the ambush and is much less difficult.

| Dice Total | Mission Type     |
|:----------:|------------------|
| 2          | Defense          |
| 3-4        | Escort           |
| 5-7        | Infantry Support |
| 8-9        | Tank Hunting     |
| 10-11      | Assault          |
| 12         | Ambush           |

### Locale
Each mission type will add some weight to those, but other than this, this is pretty straightforward.

Each locale type changes the types of ranges used on the map as well as apply other defensive or sighting modifiers.

| Dice Total | Locale      |
|:----------:|-------------|
| 1          | Open Ground |
| 2          | Wooded Area |
| 3          | Village     |
| 4          | Town        |
| 5          | City        |
| 6          | Metro       |

### Encounter
Based on the mission type, enemy composition will be generated here. 

#### To Move
Moving as it currently stands is a simple move to a better spotting location, or provide a defensive modifier against incoming fire, and nothing else. Moving will make it harder to shoot (+1) as well as be harder to hit (+1).

#### To Scout
When looking for an enemy target, roll 1D6 and modify based on the commander's skill level.

| Roll | Result      |
|:----:|-------------|
| 1-3  | Spotted     |
| 4-6  | Not Spotted |

If this fails, instead of firing that turn, a crew can also scan again if they receive a radio report from a friendly unit who has spotted them. Sending out a radio call takes no action and that crew may continue their turn, but they must also again roll on the same table with their commander. If they successfully send the report, the vehicle who failed to spot can now spot again with a similar roll but at the cost of not being able to shoot. There is also no crew skill mod as the entire crew is now actively searching.


#### To Hit
If you want to hit a far target, your dice total for a hit needs to be in the 2-4 range for example.


| Dice Total | Range Hit Potential |
|:----------:|---------------------|
| 2-4        | Far                 |
| 5-9        | Medium              |
| 10-12      | Close               |

|    Modifiers    | Reason                                                            |
|:---------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [-2,-1,0,+1,+2] | The size of the targeted tank will modify based on how big it is. |
| +1              | A moving target is harder to hit.                                 |
| +1              | Target is in a hull down position.                                |
| +2              | Target is fortified.                                              |

#### Hit Location
Decide 50/50 whether the turret or hull was hit with either a coin flip or a 1D6 roll.

#### Armor Penetration
![AP To Kill Table](http://i.imgur.com/rCxnSrY.png)

Snake Eyes will always result in a catastrophic explosion with nothing remaining.

#### AFV Destruction
When one of your AFVs receive a penetrating hit, the amount of systems destroyed is equal to the amount of the roll under the TK#. For example if your TK# was 7, and a 4 was rolled, 3 systems are randomly destroyed.

##### For Enemy Vehicles:
|  Final Effects DR | Reason            |
|:-----------------:|-------------------|
| <= Half Final TK# | Burning Wreck     |
| < Final TK#       | Eliminated        |
| = Final TK#       | Immobilized/Shock |
| > Final TK#       | Shock             |

##### Ammo Detonation Checks
Anytime Ammo is hit, roll 1D6, on a 6 ammo detonates and destroys the entire vehicle, as well as all crew in a firey explosive death.

#### Shock and Bail Checks
Anytime the vehicle is hit and a component or crew member is taken out of service, or if the armor just barely manages to stop the round, there's a shock check. If a crew is shocked, they skip their next turn. 

To determine, roll a 50/50 against commander skill.

| Roll | Result      |
|:----:|-------------|
| 1-3  | Not Shocked |
| 4-6  | Shocked     |

However if multiple components are destroyed, the crew is automatically shocked.

If multiple crew are killed, there is a shock check but instead of being shocked it results in a bail and the vehicle is abandoned.

If the vehicle is rendered absolutely combat useless, the crew automatically bails.

- - - -


## D. Results
Figure out the final results, add up scores, and roll any final events if called for after the mission is over.


- - - -


## E. Campaign Advancement
After the results of the mission have been decided, apply them to the campaign overall, and advance the campaign, after which, it's garage phase again to start the whole process over.

A Thesis Proposal of Conflict Simulation through Complex Systems

Wargaming has a long and important history of cultural impact in this world. Stemming from the 18th Century, wargaming has been employed by many nations for leadership training and conflict simulation as well as historical education and recreation. By applying the concepts of systems and game theory in the context of conflict simulation, I seek to delve into the various complications of creating a ruleset that tackles the various challenges and problems that arise from abstracting real life scenarios into realistic but fun simulations. The goal of simulating reality for these applications would be to recreate historical or hypothetical situations for learning, competitive, and casual purposes; broken down in ways that are of better understanding. By delving into and creating these systems, for my degree project I hope to produce a playable system that will be realistic, fun, and easy to understand and acquire.
